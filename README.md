# SA:GL Server listing UI
This repository contains the code that powers https://sagl.mp, our server listing website.

This interacts with the SA:GL server API: https://github.com/xeonr/sagl.mp-api which collects data via the crawler: https://github.com/xeonr/sagl.mp-crawler


## Getting started
The UI is built using React 18, rsuite (ui), react-router and styled-components. By default it will connect to the production server API.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
